HOW TO USE THE SVN
==================

[01] Download and install a Subversion client:

     http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html
     http://subversion.tigris.org
   
[02] If you don´t have one, create a sourceforge user:

     https://sourceforge.net/user/registration

[03] Create a folder in your local disk (e.g. DUMMY) and do a complete
     checkout to get the whole tree.  When it's done you can move the qpm
     folder created by the checkout to any place you like.
    
[04] To upload changes you'll need Developer (RW) status.  Please ask one
     of the Administrators to grant you such status. Note that the process
     of granting this status is not an automatic process.  Be patient.
    
[05] Do the changes needed (remember to keep track of your changes in a
     temporary file so you can later update the ChangeLog).
     Always do your development using your local SVN tree. Do not modify
     files outside your local SVN tree and then copy the changes into it,
     because that leads to overwriting changes made by others.

[06] When you're done, go on line and login to http://sourceforge.net/
     with your sourceforge user.

[07] Do an update.  NEVER forget this step to avoid overwriting changes
     made by others.

[08] Resolve all conflicts.  NEVER forget this step to avoid overwriting
     changes made by others.

[09] Update de ChangeLog using your temporary log file.  Copy the relevant
     entries to the clipboard.

[10] Do a commit.  When the SVN pops up a window with the changed files,
     check if all of them are referred in the ChangeLog.  If not, abort
     the commit, make the corrections and start over.
     
[11] Paste the ChangeLog's entries to the SVN window, save and exit.
     * ALWAYS * add a ChangeLog entry when committing changes.

[12] Wait until the process is finished and check that ended without errors.
     If there are any errors, make de corrections and start over.
     

HOW TO FORMAT YOUR CHANGELOG ENTRIES
====================================

[1] Always add new entries to the top of the file.

[2] Add an entry header using this format:

    YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC[-|+]hhmm Your Full Name <your_email_address>

[3] Add an entry body listing all the files changed, deleted or added (all of
    them with full path spec).  Mention the name of the changed function or
    macro.  Describe the changes, the reasons, and other comments and
    explanations you find useful. If the change needs some related work
    to be done by someone else (documentation, makefile), make a clear note
    about this.

[4] Group the related changes into logical sections and use the following
    marks to highlight them. Example:

    * ./dir/file1.txt
    + ./dir/file2.prg
    - ./dir/file3.ch
      * Changed: ...
      ! Fixed: ....
      % Optimized: ...
      + Added: ...
      - Removed: ...

[5] Leave an empty line between the header and body and one after the body.


HOW TO ADD SVN ID TO NEW TEXT FILES
===================================

[1] At the very top of the file insert the following lines:

/*
 * _Id_
 */

    NOTE: replace each '_' with a '$' sign.

[2] When the file is commited to SVN, the second line is changed to
    something like this:

/*
 * $Id$
 */

[3] In subsequent commits the line is updated.


HOW TO UPDATE THE TODO LIST
===========================

[1] To add new entries, insert a group of lines with the following format:

/******************************************************************************/

Assigned to: <nobody> | Full name <email address>
Added by...: 2011-09-19 22:30:00 UTC-0300 Full name <email address>
Status.....: Open | In progress | ...
Details....: <text>

/******************************************************************************/

[2] Once a task is completed, update ChangeLog and delete the group from TODO.


HOW TO BUILD QPM FROM SVN
=========================

TODO: describe procedure.

Para configurar el ambiente de trabajo por primera vez:

[1] Install the latest release from http://sourceforge.net/projects/qpm/files/

[2] Install Extended Minigui libraries, and xHarbour and BCC compiler from
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/qpm/files/minigui_para_compilar_QPM/

[3] Start QPM, go to Settings/Global Options menu, select the tab labeled
    "Extended 1.x with Borland C", and configure the fields "MiniGUI Folder",
    "Borland C Folder" and "xHarbour Folder" so they point to the folders
    created in step [2].

[4] Download the SVN from https://qpm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/qpm

[5] If you didn´t downloaded the SVN in C:\QPM folder, you must modify, build
    and execute ./HelpQPM/SHG_Change.prg to change the path to files used in
    the building of the QPM.CHM help file. The building tools do not support
    relative paths so a full default path is specified (C:\QPM\)

[5] Launch CompileAll.bat to build the binaries.


HOW TO BUILD A NEW RELEASE
==========================

[1] In QPM.PRG replace the value of var PUB_cQPM_Version with the new
    release number.

[2] Open your working version of QPM and load ./QPM_AutoProject.qpm

[3] Change version, release and build to one less than the release to build.
    E.G. if you want to build 5.01.10, set QPM to 5.01.09
    if you want to build 5.01.00, set QPM to 5.00.9999
    
[4] Build the project.

[5] To publish a patch or upgrade release:
    a) create a new folder in your local disk and name it
       QPM_<old version number>_upgrade_to_<new version number>
    b) copy QPM.EXE
    c) copy ./doc/UpgradeReadme.txt and rename it as README.TXT
    d) update README.TXT replacing OLD by <new version number>.
    e) zip the folder
    f) upload the zip file to sourceforge.

[6] To publish a new full release:
    a) create a new folder in your local disk and name it
       QPM_<new version number>
    b) copy the following file to the newly created folder:
         QPM.chm
         QPM.exe
         US_A1.exe
         US_A2.exe
         US_A3.exe
